# TAX CALCULATOR

Calculate and apply basic sales tax for the products sold in a departmental store.


## Description

```A department store needs to calculate and apply basic sales tax for the products sold in its stores. Sales tax is applied as standard 10% for all items, except Books, Food and Medical products.

An additional 5% import duty is levied on all imported products, with no exceptions.

Write a program to prepare and print the receipt for every purchase. The receipt should list the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rulesfor sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.
